Question 1
	I have worked with SVN in my previous CSSE classes at Rose including 221, 230, 232, and 320.

Question 2
	I worked with the Unix terminal in Operating Systems last quarter.

Question 3
	Git add is used to mark files for the next commit. 

Question 4
	Git commit creates a commit 'object' which holds all the changes made and added using 'add'.

Question 5
	Git push updates the group repository to match the pushing user's commit file.

Question 6
	2 people are on our team. 2 copies of the repository exist currently. One on Github and one on Ryne's computer.

Question 7
	There are 2 commits in the repository's history.

Question 8
	bellrj (Ryne Bell) owns the second commit.

Question 9
	Commit 2 added newfile.txt to the repository.

Question 10
	2 Members are our team. There are 3 branches including the master branch.

Question 11
	No username files appear on the master branch. One appears in each of the student branches.

Question 12
	Git branch creates a new branch that contains a version of the repository.

Question 13
	Git checkout tells Git that we are going to be modifying the branch and commiting work from it. We move to the user branch.

Question 14
	There are 2 members on my team and there are 3 versions of the README file. One on the master and one on each of our branches.

Question 15
	There are 2 members on my team. There were 2 merges performed: one was a fast-forward and one was manual.

Question 16
	There are still 3 branches in the GitHub repository.

Question 17
	Neither of the student branches hold the same information as the master branch. The  files were merged from the master branch, so only the master contains the saved README containing both usernames.
